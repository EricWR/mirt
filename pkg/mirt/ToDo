Roughly in order of importance:

- multicore estimation of Monte carlo logliklihood
- fitted functions for confmirt and polymirt
- nominal and rating intercept estimation for polymirt and confmirt
- nonlinear factors in confmirt (e.g., F1^2, F1*F2)
- add more extensive simulation data functions (different distributions, skew/kurtosis)
