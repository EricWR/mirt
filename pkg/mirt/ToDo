Roughly in order of importance:

- standard errors for factor scores
- prior paramter distributions for polymirt and confmirt
- expand bifactor and mirt to polytomous items (Gibbons 2007, Muraki 1995)
- MAP and EAP factor scores for polymirt and confmirt
- add more extensive simulation data functions (different distributions, skew/kurtosis)
- multiple group estimation for DIF
