Roughly in order of importance:

- MAP and EAP factor scores for polymirt and confmirt
- prior paramter distributions for polymirt and confmirt
- nominal and rating intercept estimation for polymirt and confmirt
- expand bifactor and mirt to handle polytomous items (Gibbons 2007, Muraki 1995)
- add more extensive simulation data functions (different distributions, skew/kurtosis)
- multiple group estimation for DIF
