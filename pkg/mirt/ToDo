Roughly in order of importance:

- fix bifactor estimation
- add partially compensatory mirt (Whitely 1980)
- add adaptive quadrature for nfact > 5
- expand bifactor and full information factor analysis to polytomous items (Gibbons 2007, Muraki 1995)
- allow for specific parameter constraints
- add more extensive simulation data functions (different distributions, skew/kurtosis, better selectivity of dims)
