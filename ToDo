Things to do:

- fix up confmirt code, it's getting out of hand
- multicore estimation of Monte carlo logliklihood
- nominal and rating intercept estimation for polymirt and confmirt
- multilevel structure function using lme4
- add limited-information model fit statistics
- providing standard errors for EM solutions
- bfactor() and mirt() to accommodate polytomous data
- multiple-group estimation
