Things to do:

- WLE and BME factor score estimation options
- Optional data vector input to estimate response patterns that weren't present in the dataset
- Parallel processing option for draw.thetas(), should work better now that the draws are done
mainly in R. Will be especially useful in multilevel models
- Multilevel structure function using lme4 or nlme via multimirt extension 
- Add limited-information model fit statistics
- Optimize EM function when there are free group parameters (calculate derivs)
