Things to do:

- parprior implementation for all functions
- different bounded estimation for guess and upper in Mstep.mirt
- rework tests to make use of new features

- Parallel processing option for logLik(), should work better now that the draws are done mainly in
R
- Multiple-group estimation for confmirt, now possible!
- Multilevel structure function using lme4 or nlme (via multimirt or confmirt extension )
- Add limited-information model fit statistics
